# Bushcraft
Bushcraft is a low-tech tech mod that can help you survive and gather resources, especially in the early game. It's designed for a slow-paced outdoor experience, but it could also be useful in skyblock and other resource limited modpacks.

## ALPHA RELEASE ##

This is an alpha release. There are no major known issues, but this is an early version of the mod. I'm still planning on adding some more features, and improving some of the features that are already there. I will mention any large/breaking changes in changelogs.

# Features
* Flint tools - flint tools break faster than stone tools, but are nearly as effective as iron tools
* Tree tap - gather sap from birch to make syrup, or from spruce trees to make pitch.
* Hand pump - will pump fluids from an area around the pump, as long as the player keeps pumping it.
* Drying rack - a good source of leather, string, and clay. Works similar to a campfire, but it works with hoppers.
* Washer - a coal powered block that washes blocks. Great for getting things wet or eroding them into smaller pieces.
* Crucible - place heat sources underneath it to melt blocks, or place ice under or around it to cool fluids and make them solid.
* Copper bell - make a perimeter of these around your camp, and you will hear the creepers coming. 

# Some planned features
* A rabbit snare - (spawns, and then) lures rabbits to trap them. This will be a low capacity block that will need to be checked regularly.
* A "hunter's stew" cooking pot - keep adding ingredients and water to it--just fill it back up when it starts to run low. A good way to make rotten foods edible!
* Berry harvester - slowly gather nearby berries
* Fermenting barrel - Make fizzy drinks from tree saps, honey, and berries
* Paper production - turn wood fibers into paper
* Some sort of use for leaf litter
* A few simple magical rituals - weather control, monster repellant, seed/sapling transformation
* Rudimentary enchantments - low level enchantments that can be applied to equipment without the need for an anvil
* A few (useful?) decorational blocks, like strings of fish or crude lamps
* Add configuration for tuning and customizing

# Known issues
* Sap is not rendering in Jade display
* Fluids are not rendering in REI displays
